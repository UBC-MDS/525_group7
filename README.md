# 525 Group 7 project repository

## Overview


In this project, we aim to build and deploy our own ensemble machine learning model to predict daily rainfall in Australia in the cloud for others to use. We are using a large dataset of size approximately 6GB, compiled by Prof. Tom Beuzen [DSCI 525 Example Project: Data Collection](https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2020-21/DSCI_525_web-cloud-comp_students/blob/master/get_data.ipynb). The features of the data are outputs of different climate models and the target is the actual rainfall observation.
